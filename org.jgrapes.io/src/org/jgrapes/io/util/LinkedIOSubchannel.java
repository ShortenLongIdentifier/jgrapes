/**
 * Provides an I/O subchannel that is linked to another I/O subchannel. A
 * typical use case for this class is a protocol converter.
 * 
 * Protocol converters receive events related to an I/O resource from upstream,
 * and while processing them usually generate new events to other components
 * downstream (and vice versa). The events received are associated with a
 * particular resource by the subchannel that is used to relay them. The
 * association with the resource must be maintained for the newly generated
 * events as well. It is, however, not possible to use the same subchannel for
 * receiving from upstream and sending downstream because it wouldn't be
 * possible to distinguish between e.g. an {@code Input} event from upstream to
 * the converter and an {@code Input} event (conveying the converted data) from
 * the converter to the downstream components.
 * 
 * Therefore, the converter must provide and manage independent subchannels for
 * the data streams on its downstream side with a one-to-one relationship to the
 * upstream subchannels. The {@code LinkedIOSubchannel} class simplifies this
 * task. It provides a new subchannel with a reference to an existing 
 * subchannel. This makes it easy to find the upstream subchannel for a 
 * given downstream ({@code LinkedIOSubchannel}) when processing response
 * events. For finding the downstream {@code IOSubchannel} for a given upstream
 * connection, instances associate themselves with the upstream channel using
 * the converter component as key. This allows a subchannel to have several
 * associated linked subchannels.
