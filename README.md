JGrapes
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mnlipp/jgrapes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mnlipp/jgrapes)

See the [project's home page](http://mnlipp.github.io/jgrapes/).

This repository comprises the basic JGrapes components that can be used as
libraries. These library components have the augmentes manifest to be used
as OSGi bundles, but they do not depend in any way on the OSGi framework.
    
The JGrapes OSGi components that do depend on the OSGi framework and 
provide JGrapes based OSGi services can be found in a
[seperate repository](https://github.com/mnlipp/jgrapes-osgi) because
they profit from a different top-level build approach.
